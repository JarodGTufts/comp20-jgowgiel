### 1. This repository was created for the COMP 20 Web Development course at Tufts University.

### 2. I most enjoyed Assignment 3, where we were tasked with creating a simple web server using Heroku. I found this to be the most educational assignment of the course; using the knowledge I have gained from this assignment, I have been creating my own standalone application as a side project, [which remains unfinished for now](https://queue-collab.herokuapp.com) but is a great example of the knowledge that I have gained from this assignment just to be able to create a heroku app.

### 3. Since day one of this course, I have grown a lot. Learning how to properly set up and create servers and websites has enabled me to pursue many personal projects that, previously, I had no idea how to even begin. 

### 4. The most important thing I have learned from this course is how to build an entirely self-contained web application. From database integration to the use of a Heroku server to provide the site itself, this course has enabled me to explore any web based project I could come up with. For example, I have had a long running desire to build a podcast hosting site, and have also recently started developing another side project which I linked above. With the knowledge from this class, I could (and fully intend to) pursue both of these projects.

### 5. I would really like to delve deeper into web application development and to continue refining my knowledge and level of comfort with asynchronous functions and using web frameworks such as Bootstrap.
