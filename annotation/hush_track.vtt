00:00:9.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Children have You ever met the Bogeyman before
No, of course You haven't for You're much too good, I'm sure;
Don't You be afraid of him if he should visit You,
He's a great big coward, so I'll tell You what to do

2
00:00:25 --> 00:00:41
Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman,
Don't let him come too close to You, he'll catch you if he can.
Just pretend that you're a crocodile
And you will find that Bogeyman will run away a mile.

3
00:00:41 --> 00:00:57
Say Shoo shoo and stick him with a pin
Bogeyman will very nearly jump out of his skin
Say buzz buzz just like the wasps that sting
Bogeyman will think you are an elephant with wings

4
00:00:57 --> 00:01:12
Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman
Tell him you've got soldiers in your bed
For he will never guess that they are only made of lead

5
00:01:12 --> 00:01:35
Say Hush hush, he'll think that you're asleep
If you make a lovely snore away he'll softly creep
Sing this tune you children one and all
Bogeyman will run away, he'll think it's Henry Hall!

6
00:01:35 --> 00:01:51
When the shadows of the evening creep across the sky
And your Mummy comes upstairs to sing a lullaby
Tell her that the bogeyman no longer frightens you
Uncle Henry's very kindly told you what to do

7
00:01:51 --> 00:02:06
Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman
Don't let him come too close to you, He'll catch you if he can.
Just pretend your teddy bear's a dog
Then shout out, 'Fetch him, Teddy!' and he'll hop off like a frog.

8
00:02:15 --> 00:02:30
Say Meoow, pretend that you're a cat
He'll think you may scratch him that make him fall down flat
Just pretend he isn't really there
You will find that Bogey man will vanish in thin air

9
00:02:38 --> 00:02:47
Here's one way to catch him without fail
Just keep a little salt with you
and put it on his tail
