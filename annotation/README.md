# What has been implemented correctly?

## I believe that I have implemented the entire assignment properly. As well, I have chosen to write a small little loop that builds a valid, pseudorandom HEX code that is then used as the color of the lyric, to cause the color to randomly switch every time that a timeupdate event is registered.

# Anyone whom I have collaborated with on this assignment

## The inspiration for the random hex generator was take from a stack oveflow post, but the implementation after being given the idea for generating a set of six random valid characters is my own. Outside of this, I have not received any external help on this assignment.

# How long has it taken to complete?

## It took me approximately two hours to complete this assignment.
