                    No, of course You haven't for You're much too good, I'm sure;<br>
                    Don't You be afraid of him if he should visit You,<br>
                    He's a great big coward, so I'll tell You what to do<br>`,
            
            second: `Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman,<br>
                    Don't let him come too close to You, he'll catch you if he can.<br>
                    Just pretend that you're a crocodile<br>
                    And you will find that Bogeyman will run away a mile.<br>`,

            third:  `Say Shoo shoo and stick him with a pin<br>
                    Bogeyman will very nearly jump out of his skin<br>
                    Say buzz buzz just like the wasps that sting<br>
                    Bogeyman will think you are an elephant with wings<br>`,

            fourth: `Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman<br>
                    Tell him you've got soldiers in your bed<br>
                    For he will never guess that they are only made of lead<br>`,

            fifth: `Say Hush hush, he'll think that you're asleep<br>
                    If you make a lovely snore away he'll softly creep<br>
                    Sing this tune you children one and all<br>
                    Bogeyman will run away, he'll think it's Henry Hall!<br>`,

            sixth: `When the shadows of the evening creep across the sky<br>
                    And your Mummy comes upstairs to sing a lullaby<br>
                    Tell her that the bogeyman no longer frightens you<br>
                    Uncle Henry's very kindly told you what to do<br>`,

            seventh: `Hush, hush, hush, here comes the Bogeyman<br>
                    Don't let him come too close to you, He'll catch you if he can.<br>
                    Just pretend your teddy bear's a dog<br>
                    Then shout out, 'Fetch him, Teddy!' and he'll hop off like a frog.<br>`,

            eighth: `Say Meoow, pretend that you're a cat<br>
                    He'll think you may scratch him that make him fall down flat<br>
                    Just pretend he isn't really there<br>
                    You will find that Bogey man will vanish in thin air<br>`,

            ninth: `Here's one way to catch him without fail<br>
                    Just keep a little salt with you<br>
                    and put it on his tail<br>`
